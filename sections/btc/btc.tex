\section{Annual Electricity Usage of the Bitcoin Network}\label{section:btc}
\textbf{Disclaimer: Information regarding the electricity usage required to operate Bitcoin mining machines \textit{is} an estimate based on inherently public hashrate data, however some assumptions are made by in order to estimate the final electricity usage figures.
  The Galaxy Digital Mining Team encourages external thoughts and contributions that result in the most accurate figures possible.

\subsubsection{Methodology}
The estimated total annual electricity usage required to operate the Bitcoin network is calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:btc-total}
  E_\textrm{BTC} = E_\textrm{Miners} + E_\textrm{Pools} + E_\textrm{Nodes}  
\end{equation}
\noindent
Where,

\begin{align*}
&E_\textrm{BTC}     \textrm{ \ \  = Estimated total annual electricity usage of the Bitcoin network, $\xwhyr{T}$} \\
&E_\textrm{Miners}  \textrm{      = Estimated total annual electricity usage of Bitcoin miners, $\xwhyr{T}$} \\
&E_\textrm{Pools}   \textrm{ \ \  = Estimated total annual eletricity usage of Bitcoin pools, $\xwhyr{T}$} \\
&E_\textrm{Nodes}   \textrm{ \    = Estimated total annual electricity usage of Bitcoin nodes, $\xwhyr{T}$}
\end{align*}

Using the results described in Sections \ref{sec:btc-miners} - \ref{sec:btc-nodes} below, Eq. \eqref{eqn:btc-total} is solved as follows:

\begin{align}\label{eqn:btc-total-res}
  E_\textrm{BTC} &= E_\textrm{Miners} + E_\textrm{Pools} + E_\textrm{Nodes} \nonumber \\
                 &= 113.8800 \xwhyr{T} + 0.0086 \xwhyr{T} + 0.0054 \xwhyr{T} \nonumber \\
                 &= 113.8940 \xwhyr{T} \nonumber \\
                 &= 113.89 \xwhyr{T}
\end{align}

Therefore, the estimated total annual electricity usage required to operate the Bitcoin network is 113.89 $\xwhyr{T}$.
